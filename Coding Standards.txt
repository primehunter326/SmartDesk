Coding Standards:

At the beginning of each file there should be a statement of what
the function defines in a general sense, and any important information

Braces should not waste verticle space:

	//do this
	if(somefunction()){
		//...
	}

	do not do this:
	if(somefunction())
	{
		//...
	}


Function names should be camel case:
do: someReallyLongButRatherDescriptiveFunctionName()
do not: some_really_long_function_name()

Constants should be in all caps:
CHAR * BACON = "I LOVE BACON"
It is appropriate to use _ to seperate constant's seperate words 
if reading the constant is difficult without doing so

If a variable being passed to a function is guaranteed to be read-only within 
the function (and any calling functions within that one), then it should be designated const

Comments should be descriptive, and describe oddities in code or 
explain why an include is needed, etc.... no need to comment while
loops like: "this is a while loop bla"

Header files in C should attempt to list their functions in the same order as in the .c file
they correspond to (if applicable), this will make searching for functions easier

There will be a single main in the application. This main will reside in the engine
