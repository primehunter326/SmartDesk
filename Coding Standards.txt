Coding Standards:

At the beginning of each file there should be a statement of what
the function defines in a general sense, and any important information

Braces should not waste verticle space:

	//do this
	if(somefunction()){
		//...
	}

	do not do this:
	if(somefunction())
	{
		//...
	}


Function names should be camel case:
do: someReallyLongButRatherDescriptiveFunctionName()
do not: some_really_long_function_name()

Constants should be in all caps:
CONST CHAR * BACON = "I LOVE BACON"

Comments should be descriptive, and describe oddities in code or 
explain why an include is needed, etc.... no need to comment while
loops like: "this is a while loop bla"

Header files in C should attempt to list their functions in the same order as in the .c file
they correspond to (if applicable), this will make searching for functions easier

There will be a single main in the application. This main will reside in the engine
