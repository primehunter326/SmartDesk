This file handles running the network and the graphics simultaneously. 
Setting up the memory share between the two and sets them each up on
their own thread. Once both are running the engine simply waits for
the two processes/threads to finish and then will clean up the files
made and such.

-Initial thoughts:
	Use memory mapped file (size specified in conf.h) with read for the graphics, write access for network
	pthreads for running the graphics and the network at the same time.

-TODO:
	Create a logging structure and use that instead of 'puts'
	pthreads
